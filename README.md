## Purpose
This will be a DM helper application, that will allow you to quickly keep track of your party's skills and have a basic 
initiative tracker.

##Planned features

####Dice roller:

* Each tab will have a quick roller at the top which will allow you to roll any single XdY+Z roll
  * TODO: Currently, during the app set up the addition of the roller to each tab is called by a function. The roller 
  itself could probably be made into its own class
* In addition, there is a dedicated roll expression parser tab, which will let you type any number of complicated die rolls
and it will evaluate all of them


#### Initiative tracker:
* Page dedicated to combat
* Keep track of the initiative order of combat, status effects, and HP
* Sidebar with a list of number counters (takes in: starting number, source, and notes) to track spells and effects


#### Import a party:
* This will have a form to load a character or monster one by one
* This will also have the option to load a text file in a specific format to load many characters at once.

####Skill tracker:
* By party member, lists the modifiers to skills, saving throws, and attack bonus

* Button to auto roll any skill in the list
